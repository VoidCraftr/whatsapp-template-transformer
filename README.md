## 🔮 What is this sorcery?

**WaGenie** is an intelligent AI suite designed to help businesses navigate the strict, often confusing world of the **Meta/WhatsApp Business API**. 

We don't just "fix" your templates; we transmute risky, promotional marketing copy into safe, compliant, and cost-effective **Utility** messages.

## 🚀 The Toolbox

> *Stop getting rejected. Start getting delivered.*

### 🔄 **1. The Alchemist (Converter)**
Transmutes aggressive "Sales" language into neutral "Utility" updates. 
- *Input:* "BUY NOW 50% OFF!!!" 
- *Output:* "Your order update is ready." 
- **Benefit:** Saves money (Utility rates < Marketing rates) and increases approval odds.

### ⚖️ **2. The Oracle (Policy Checker)**
A stringent, AI-powered compliance officer that audits your text *before* you submit it to Meta.
- Detects banned words, floating parameters, and spam traps.
- Gives you a "PASS" or "FAIL" with detailed reasons.

### 🎯 **3. The Arbiter (Category Advisor)**
Confused if your message is "Marketing" or "Utility"? The Arbiter decides.
- Analyzes context to assign the correct billing category.
- Prevents "Mixed Category" billing shocks.

### 📊 **4. The Judge (Scorer)**
Grades your template on a strict 10-point scale.
- **Compliance:** 3 pts
- **Clarity:** 3 pts
- **Engagement:** 2 pts
- **Optimization:** 2 pts
